Retail Sales SQL Analysis

🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes a retail sales dataset (Superstore) using SQL to uncover sales trends, profitability insights, customer behavior, and discount effectiveness.
The goal is to simulate a real-world business analysis task and generate actionable recommendations for decision-makers.

🗂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Sample Superstore Dataset

Records: Retail orders with sales, profit, discounts, products, customers, regions, and dates

Data Cleaning Performed:

Converted order_date and ship_date to proper DATE format

Removed invalid date values

Ensured numeric consistency for sales, profit, discount, and quantity

🛠 Tools & Skills Used

MySQL

SQL Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

Date functions (YEAR, MONTH)

GROUP BY & ORDER BY

Business analytics thinking

📊 Key Analyses Performed

1️⃣ Sales & Profit Performance

Total sales and profit by category and sub-category

Average discount and number of orders

Identified high-revenue but low-profit product lines

2️⃣ Order Quantity Trends

Monthly order quantity analysis

Identified seasonal demand patterns

3️⃣ Revenue & Profit Trend Analysis

Monthly sales and profit trends

Comparison of high-revenue vs high-profit periods

4️⃣ Regional & Category Performance

Sales and profit distribution across regions

Category and sub-category performance by geography

5️⃣ Discount Impact Analysis

Average discount by category

Relationship between discount levels and total profit

6️⃣ Customer Behavior Analysis

Analyzed repeat purchasing behavior

7️⃣ Profit Margin Analysis

Profit margin by category

Profit margin by sub-category

Highlighted inefficient and high-performing product lines

📌 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

Prioritize high-profit sub-categories rather than only high-sales products.

Re-evaluate discount strategies in categories where high discounts lead to reduced profitability.

Invest more in regions with consistent sales and profit growth.

Optimize or discontinue sub-categories with persistently low or negative profit margins.

Develop loyalty programs targeting high-value repeat customers.

Align inventory planning with seasonal quantity trends to reduce overstocking.

Focus marketing efforts on categories that show both strong sales and strong margins.
