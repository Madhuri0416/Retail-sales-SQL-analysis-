📌 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

Prioritize high-profit sub-categories rather than only high-sales products.

Re-evaluate discount strategies in categories where high discounts lead to reduced profitability.

Invest more in regions with consistent sales and profit growth.

Optimize or discontinue sub-categories with persistently low or negative profit margins.

Develop loyalty programs targeting high-value repeat customers.

Align inventory planning with seasonal quantity trends to reduce overstocking.

Focus marketing efforts on categories that show both strong sales and strong margins.
